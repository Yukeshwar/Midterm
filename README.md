For my project, Iâ€™ve chosen one of my all-time favorite albums, Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.The album explores Kanye's relationship with fame, excess, self-destruction, and redemption, blending genres like hip-hop, orchestral music, and rock. I plan to focus on the fragmented and chaotic nature of the album, drawing inspiration from its controversial cover and themes. The central visual will be abstract, representing how fantasy and fame can distort reality. The project will be time-based, with visuals that change and evolve over time, reflecting the emotional journey and shifting tones within the album. By distorting the imagery over time, I aim to symbolize Kanye's exploration of ego, excess, and self-destruction.
